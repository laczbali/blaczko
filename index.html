		<h1>Balazs Laczko</h1>

			<div class="about-div">
				I was born in Miskolc, Hungary in 1996.
				In 2015 I moved to Debrecen to study at university, and I still live here.
			</div>

			<div class="about-div">
				Since middle school I've been studying <b>electrical engineering</b>.
				I've found out during all those years that my main interest in the field
				is working with <b>embedded systems</b>. It has a good mix of digital design and programming,
				which really appeals to me.
			</div>

			<div class="about-div">
				Altough we learned a bit of programming in middle school,
				my interest kicked off when we learned <b>C</b> programming in the first year of the BSc course.
				Once I had a good base understanding of it, I started to learn <b>C#</b> in my own time.
				It really appeals to me, I like the way it's structured and used.
			</div>

			<div class="about-div">
				Later, at my job with NI, I had the opportunity to work on a web development project.
				It was there, that I learned to use <b>Angular</b> with <b>TypeScript</b>,
				as I became the <b>frontend developer</b> of the website.
			</div>

			<div class="about-div">
				Not long after our 1.0 release, the backend developer left the company, so I took over
				his roles as well. In that role I had to familiarize myself
				with <b>Python</b> and <b>SQL</b>. I've grown to like the technologies, and I use them 
				more and more in my spare time as well.
			</div>

			<div class="about-div">
				In my job at NI Hungary Kft I have worked on a lot of different projects,
				each having something unique about them.
				I mostly work with <b>LabVIEW</b> and <b>TestStand</b>,
				as well as wide variety of <b>National Instruments hardware products</b>.
				The work is challenging, as we need to work with people spread out on three international sites,
				each project has some new technology in it, and in my role the engineer also serves
				as a kind of project manager.
